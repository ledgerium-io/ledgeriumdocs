# Quorum Examples

The following examples can be used to demonstrate the functionality offered by Quorum as well as provide the means to easily create pre-configured networks for testing/development.

Current examples include:

* [7nodes](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum-examples.git): Starts up a fully-functioning Quorum environment consisting of 7 independent nodes. This example demonstrates consensus, privacy, and all the expected functionality of an Ethereum platform.
* [5nodesRTGS](https://github.com/bacen/quorum-examples/tree/master/examples/5nodesRTGS): Starts up a set of 5 nodes that simulates a Real-time Gross Settlement environment with 3 banks, one regulator (typically a central bank) and an observer that cannot access the private data.

    The 5nodesRTGS example links to an external repo which you will need to clone, thanks to **@rsarres** for this contribution!
