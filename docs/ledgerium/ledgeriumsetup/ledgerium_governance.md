# **Governance**
Governance DApp is a way for validators to participate in on-chain governance. There is limited 21 seats for validators on Ledgerium Blockchain. This number is however subjected to change.  

## **Role of Validators**
A Validator is an independent individual who stakes their XLG and is entrusted to maintain a node on the network that validates transactions and commits new blocks to the blockchain. Validators receive a reward in XLG for provisioning blocks.

## **Responsibilites for Validators**
A Validator has both technical and social responsiblities both of which are important for the health, performance and security of the network.

### **Technical Responsibilites**
-   Ensure node is secure by practicing safe key management
-   Maintain node requisite software version
-   Monitor node to ensure its availablility and participation in consensus
-   Monitor network in general and communicate with other Validators, network entities if problems arise.

### **Social Responsibilites**
-   Participate in on-chain Governace of the network

Governance is a collection of DApps where ballots are proposed and voted on by existing Validators to manage the network. The Ballot types include:
-   Adding new Validators
-   Removing Validators, i.e. for compromising security of network,
    malicious behavior, non-participation in Governance

### **Prerequisites**
To participate in Governance, you must:
-   Be voted in as a Validator
-   Have the Ledgerium Wallet installed
-   Import your private key associated to your validator status to the wallet

### **What constitutes a passing vote**
A vote is passed if the sum is greater than to n/2, where n is the number of existing validator nodes

### **Getting started with Governance**
Every masternode is given access to Governance DApp which can be accessed at @ http://<IP Address>:3545.
