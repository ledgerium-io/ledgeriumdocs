## **What is a smart contract?**
A contract is a collection of code (its functions) and data (its state) that resides at a specific address on the Ledgerium blockchain. Contract accounts are able to pass messages between themselves as well as doing practically Turing complete computation. Contracts live on the blockchain in a Ledgerium-specific binary format called Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode. At the most basic level, they are programs that run as they’ve been set up to run by the people who developed them. The benefits of smart contracts are most apparent in business collaborations, in which they are typically used to enforce some type of agreement so that all participants can be certain of the outcome without an intermediary’s involvement.

Contracts are typically written in some high level language such as [Solidity](https://solidity.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) and then compiled into bytecode to be uploaded on the blockchain.

## **What do smart contracts do?**
In a financial transactions, where multiple stakeholders involved and every party has to function seemelessly, Smart contracts can play important role. Smart contracts on blockchain streamlines the complex process that involves several stakeholders because of a lack of trust among participants in the transaction. With user identity stored on a blockchain, lenders can quickly make a decision about credit to the user. A smart contract can be created between user's bank, the dealer and the lender so that once the funds have been released to the dealer, the lender will hold the car’s title and repayment will be initiated based on the agreed terms. The transfer of ownership would be automatic as the transaction gets recorded to a blockchain, is shared among the participants and can be checked at any time.

## **How do smart contracts work?**
Let’s see how smart contract works in a supply chain scenario. Buyer B wants to buy something from Seller A, so she puts money in an escrow account. Seller A will use Shipper C to deliver the product to Buyer B. When Buyer B receives the item, the money in escrow will be released to Seller A and Shipper C. If Buyer B doesn’t receive the shipment by Date Z, the money in escrow will be returned. When this transaction is executed, Manufacturer G is notified to create another of the items that was sold to increase supply. All this is done automatically through logic written inside smart contract. 

Smart contracts work by following simple “if/when…then…” statements that are written into code on a blockchain. A network of computers executes the actions (releasing funds to the appropriate parties; registering a vehicle; sending notifications; issuing a ticket) when predetermined conditions have been met and verified. The blockchain is then updated when the transaction is completed.

## **What are the benefits of smart contracts?**
The benefits of smart contracts go hand-in-hand with blockchain.

**Speed and accuracy**  
Smart contracts are digital and automated, so you won’t have to spend time processing paperwork or reconciling and correcting the errors that are often written into documents that have been filled manually. Computer code is also more exact than the legalese that traditional contracts are written in.

**Trust**  
Smart contracts automatically execute transactions following predetermined rules, and the encrypted records of those transactions are shared across participants. Thus, nobody has to question whether information has been altered for personal benefit.

**Security**  
Blockchain transaction records are encrypted, and that makes them very hard to hack. Because each individual record is connected to previous and subsequent records on a distributed ledger, the whole chain would need to be altered to change a single record.

**Savings**  
Smart contracts remove the need for intermediaries because participants can trust the visible data and the technology to properly execute the transaction. There is no need for an extra person to validate and verify the terms of an agreement because it is built into the code.
