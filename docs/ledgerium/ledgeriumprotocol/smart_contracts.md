## **What is a smart contract?**

As per [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract),smart contract is a computer protocol intended to digitally facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract. Smart contracts allow the performance of credible transactions without third parties. These transactions are trackable and irreversible.

Contract accounts are able to pass messages between themselves as well as doing practically Turing complete computation. Contracts live on the blockchain in a Ledgerium-specific binary format called Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode.

Contracts are typically written in some high level language such as [Solidity](https://solidity.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) and then compiled into bytecode to be uploaded on the blockchain.

## **What is smart contracts role?**

Smart contracts can play important role during financial transactions, wherein multiple stakeholders are involved and every party has to function seamlessly. Smart contracts on blockchain streamlines the complex process by adding an extra layer of security. This builds trust among multiple participants involved in the transaction. With user identity stored on a blockchain, lenders can quickly make a decision about credit to the user.

A smart contract can be created between user's bank, the dealer and the lender so that once the funds have been released to the dealer, the lender will hold the car’s title and repayment will be initiated based on the agreed terms. The transfer of ownership would be automatic as the transaction gets recorded to a blockchain, is shared among the participants and can be checked at any time.

## **How do smart contracts work?**

Let’s see how smart contract works in a supply chain scenario. Buyer B wants to buy something from Seller A, so she puts money in an escrow account. Seller A will use Shipper C to deliver the product to Buyer B. When Buyer B receives the item, the money in escrow will be released to Seller A and Shipper C. If Buyer B doesn’t receive the shipment by Date Z, the money in escrow will be returned. When this transaction is executed, Manufacturer G is notified to create another list of the items that was sold to increase supply. All this is done automatically through logic written inside smart contract.

Smart contracts work by following simple “if/when…then…” statements that are written into code on a blockchain. A network of computers executes the actions (releasing funds to the appropriate parties; registering a vehicle; sending notifications; issuing a ticket) when predetermined conditions have been met and verified. The blockchain is then updated when the transaction is completed.

## **What are the benefits of smart contracts?**

The benefits of smart contracts go hand-in-hand with blockchain.

**Speed and accuracy**  
The automated smart contracts removes manual errors, maintain exact computer code and thereby greatly reduce the time spent in processing paperwork.

**Trust**  
All contracts run as per pre-agreed terms and rules and encrypted transaction records are shared amongst participants. Thus, the transparent functiong of smart contracts inculcate a feeling of trust among the blockchain network.

**Security**  
As all transaction records are encrypted, making it very difficult to hack and change any individual record. Each individual block/record is connected in a chain of previous and subsequent
records on a distributed ledger. The whole chain would need to be altered for modifying a single record.

**Savings**  
Smart contracts remove the need for intermediaries because participants can trust the visible data and the technology to properly execute the transaction. There is no need for an central authority/third-party to validate and verify the terms of an agreement because it is built into the code.
