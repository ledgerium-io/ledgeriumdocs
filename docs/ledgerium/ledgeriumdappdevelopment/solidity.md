# **Solidity**  
Solidity is a high level smart contract language similar to JavaScript which allows you to develop contracts and compile to EVM bytecode. It is currently the flagship language of Ethereum and the most popular. Smart Contracts are compiled using the solidity compiler and turn into Etheruem binary format called bytecode which are deployed to the blockchain. This bytecode gets executed by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

## **Writing a contract**
A "Hello World" program in Solidity is of even less use than in other languages, but still:
```
pragma solidity ^0.5.1;

contract HelloWorld {
  function helloWorld() external pure returns (string memory) {
    return "Hello, World!";
  }
}
```
This contract will send greet message after its construction.

## **Compiling a contract**
Compilation of solidity contracts can be accomplished via a number of mechanisms.

-   Using the `solc` compiler via the command line.
-   Using `web3.eth.compile.solidity` in the javascript console provided by `geth` or `eth` (This still requires the `solc` compiler to be installed).
-   The [online Solidity realtime compiler](https://Ledgerium.github.io/browser-solidity/).
-   The [ReMix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
-   The [Ethereum Wallet](https://github.com/Ethereum/mist/releases).

    More information on solc and compiling Solidity contract code can be found [here](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.10/using-the-compiler.html).

## **Compiling a simple contract**
### **Create and deploy a contract**

Before you begin this section, make sure you have both an unlocked account as well as some funds.

You will now create a contract on the blockchain by [sending a transaction](https://github.com/Ledgerium/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API#web3ethsendtransaction) to the empty address with the EVM code from the previous section as data.

!!! note 
    This can be accomplished much easier using the [online Solidity realtime compiler](https://Ledgerium.github.io/browser-solidity/) or the [Mix IDE](https://github.com/Ledgerium/wiki/wiki/Mix:-The-DApp-IDE) program.

```
var primaryAddress = eth.accounts[0]
var abi = [{ constant: false, inputs: { name: 'a', type: 'uint256' } }]
var MyContract = eth.contract(abi)
var contract = MyContract.new(arg1, arg2, ..., {from: primaryAddress, data: EVMByteCodeFromPreviousSection})
```

All binary data is serialised in hexadecimal form. Hex strings always have a hex prefix `0x`.

!!! note   
    Note that `arg1, arg2, ...` are the arguments for the contract: constructor, in case it accepts any. If the contract does not require any constructor arguments then these arguments can be omitted.

It is worth pointing out that this step requires you to pay for execution. Your balance on the account (that you put as sender in the `from` field) will be reduced according to the gas rules of the EVM once your transaction makes it into a block. After some time, your transaction should appear included in a block confirming that the state it brought about is a consensus. Your contract now lives on the blockchain.

The asynchronous way of doing the same looks like this:
```
MyContract.new([arg1, arg2, ...,]{from: primaryAccount, data: EVMCode}, function(err, contract) {
  if (!err && contract.address)
    console.log(contract.address);
});
```

### **Interacting with a contract**

Interaction with a contract is typically done using an abstraction layer such as the [eth.contract()](https://github.com/Ledgerium/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API#web3ethcontract) function which returns a javascript object with all of the contract functions available as callable functions in javascript.

The standard way to describe the available functions of a contract is the [ABI definition](https://github.com/Ledgerium/wiki/wiki/Ledgerium-Contract-ABI). This object is an array which describles the call signature and return values for each available contract function.

```
var Multiply7 = eth.contract(contract.info.abiDefinition);
var myMultiply7 = Multiply7.at(address);
```

Now all the function calls specified in the ABI are made available on the contract instance. You can just call those methods on the contract instance in one of two ways.

``` 
myMultiply7.multiply.sendTransaction(3, {from: address})
"0x12345"
myMultiply7.multiply.call(3)
21
```

When called using `sendTransaction` the function call is executed via sending a transaction. This will cost ether to send and the call will be recorded forever on the blockchain. The return value of calls made in this manner is the hash of the transaction.

When called using `call` the function is executed locally in the EVM and the return value of the function is returned with the function. Calls made in this manner are not recorded on the blockchain and thus, cannot modify the internal state of the contract. This manner of call is referred to as a **constant** function call. Calls made in this manner do not cost any ether.

You should use `call` if you are interested only in the return value and use `sendTransaction` if you only care about *side effects* on the state of the contract.

In the example above, there are no side effects, therefore `sendTransaction` only burns gas and increases the entropy of the universe.

### **Contract metadata**
In the previous sections we explained how you create a contract on the blockchain. Now we will deal with the rest of the compiler output, the **contract metadata** or contract info.

When interacting with a contract you did not create you might want documentation or to look at the source code. Contract authors are encouraged to make such information available by registering it on the blockchain or through a third party service, such as [EtherChain](https://www.etherchain.org/contracts). The `admin` API provides convenience methods to fetch this bundle for any contract that chose to register.

```
// get the contract info for contract address to do manual verification
var info = admin.getContractInfo(address) // lookup, fetch, decode
var source = info.source;
var abiDef = info.abiDefinition
```

The underlying mechanism that makes this work is is that:
-   contract info is uploaded somewhere identifiable by a *URI* which is publicly accessible
-   anyone can find out what the *URI* is only knowing the contracts address

These requirements are achieved using a 2 step blockchain registry. The first step registers the contract code (hash) with a content hash in a contract called `HashReg`. The second step registers a url with the content hash in the `UrlHint` contract. These [registry contracts](https://github.com/Ledgerium/go-Ledgerium/blob/develop/common/registrar/contracts.go)
were part of the Frontier release and have carried on into Homestead.

By using this scheme, it is sufficient to know a contract's address to look up the url and fetch the actual contract metadata info bundle.

So if you are a conscientious contract creator, the steps are the following:
 - Deploy the contract itself to the blockchain
 - Get the contract info json file.
 - Deploy contract info json file to any url of your choice
 - Register codehash -\content hash -\url

The JS API makes this process very easy by providing helpers. Call `admin.register` to extract info from the contract, write out its json serialisation in the given file, calculates the content hash of the file and finally registers this content hash to the contract's code hash. Once you deployed that file to any url, you can use `admin.registerUrl` to register the url with your content hash on the blockchain as well. (Note that in case a fixed content addressed model is used as document store, the url-hint is no longer necessary.)

```
source = "contract test { function multiply(uint a) returns(uint d) { return a * 7; } }"
// compile with solc
contract = eth.compile.solidity(source).test
// create contract object
var MyContract = eth.contract(contract.info.abiDefinition)
// extracts info from contract, save the json serialisation in the given file,
contenthash = admin.saveInfo(contract.info, "~/dapps/shared/contracts/test/info.json")
// send off the contract to the blockchain
MyContract.new({from: primaryAccount, data: contract.code}, function(error, contract){
  if(!error && contract.address) {
    // calculates the content hash and registers it with the code hash in `HashReg`
    // it uses address to send the transaction.
    // returns the content hash that we use to register a url
    admin.register(primaryAccount, contract.address, contenthash)
    // here you deploy ~/dapps/shared/contracts/test/info.json to a url
    admin.registerUrl(primaryAccount, hash, url)
  }
});
```

## **Testing contracts and transactions**

Often you need to resort to a low level strategy of testing and debugging contracts and transactions. This section introduces some debug tools and practices you can use. In order to test contracts and transactions without real-word consequences, you best test it on a private blockchain. This can be achieved with configuring an alternative network id (select a unique integer) and/or disable peers.

It is recommended practice that for testing you use an alternative data directory and ports so that you never even accidentally clash with your live running node (assuming that runs using the defaults. Starting your `geth` with in VM debug mode with profiling and highest logging verbosity level is recommended:

```
geth --datadir ~/dapps/testing/00/ --port 30310 --rpcport 8110 --networkid 4567890 --nodiscover --maxpeers 0 --vmdebug --verbosity 6 --pprof --pprofport 6110 console 2~/dapp/testint/00/00.log
```

Before you can submit any transactions, you need set up your private test chain. See test-networks.

```
// create account. will prompt for password
personal.newAccount();
// name your primary account, will often use it
primary = eth.accounts[0];
// check your balance (denominated in ether)
balance = web3.fromWei(eth.getBalance(primary), "ether");
```

``` 
// assume an existing unlocked primary account
primary = eth.accounts[0];

// mine 10 blocks to generate ether

// starting miner
miner.start(4);
// sleep for 10 blocks (this can take quite some time).
admin.sleepBlocks(10);
// then stop mining (just not to burn heat in vain)
miner.stop();
balance = web3.fromWei(eth.getBalance(primary), "ether");
```

After you create transactions, you can force process them with the
following lines:

``` 
miner.start(1);
admin.sleepBlocks(1);
miner.stop();
```

You can check your pending transactions with:

``` 
// shows transaction pool
txpool.status
// number of pending txs
eth.getBlockTransactionCount("pending");
// print all pending txs
eth.getBlock("pending", true).transactions
```

If you submitted contract creation transaction, you can check if the desired code actually got inserted in the current blockchain:

``` 
txhash = eth.sendTansaction({from:primary, data: code})
//... mining
contractaddress = eth.getTransactionReceipt(txhash);
eth.getCode(contractaddress)
```
