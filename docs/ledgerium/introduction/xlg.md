#**What is XLG?**  
Ledgerium is a public blockchain, where validators are chosen based on various factors. Of all possible validators, 20% will always be maintained by ledgerium. 40% will be given to top universities and public institutions, and the remaining 40% will be given to enterprises or the open market. This will ensure at all times, we have 60% of validators locked and producing blocks, no matter what the value of the token is. Ether is the name of the currency used within Ledgerium. It is used to pay for computation within the EVM. This is done indirectly by purchasing gas for XLG as explained in gas-and-XLG.
