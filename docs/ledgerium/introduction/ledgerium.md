# **What is Ledgerium Blockchain**

The Blockledger is an organisation that brings Blockchain to the accounting and audit industry. We utilize a decentralized ledger through a triple entry accounting system.

Ledgerium Blockchain is a distributed digital ledger that can record transactions between parties efficiently in a verifiable and permanent way. This allows the participants to verify and audit transactions instantly and inexpensively. The merits of Blockchain technology are exactly match the requirements of accounting and auditing industry.

Ledgerium Blockchain draws inspiration from J.P. Morgan's Quorum Protocol (_Based on the Etherum Foundation's Ethereum Protocol_).

### **Ethereum**

Ethereum is an open-source, public, blockchain-based distributed computing platform and operating system featuring smart contract (scripting) functionality. It supports a modified version of Nakamoto consensus via transaction-based state transitions. [^1]

### **Quorum**

Quorum is an Ethereum-based distributed ledger protocol that has been developed to provide the Financial Services Industry with a permissioned implementation of Ethereum that supports the transaction and contract privacy. [^2]

## **Key Features**

### **Distributed and Decentralized**

Ledgerium blockchain maintains a distributed and decentralized ledger. This ensures that no single computer/node can administer control over the process, making the system considerably secure.

### **Immutability**

Ledgerium Blockchain uses Istanbul Byzantine Fault Tolerance (IBFT) consensus mechanism for maintaining immutability meaning that the ledger of transactions once updated can’t be reversed or edited. All blockchain participants are responsible for validating transactions. If any of the participants try to update the content, other blockchain participants will immediately identify the discrepancy and invalidate the changes.

### **Public as well as private transactions**

Ledgerium Blockchain draws inspiration from J.P. Morgan's Quorum Protocol. The protocol classifies the transactions into two types public and private. Public transactions are accessible to anyone. Private Transactions will be accessible for any predefined enterprise blockchain master nodes.

### **High Throughput**

Under Istanbul Byzantine Fault Tolerance (IBFT) consensus, a specified number of high performing nodes are selected by the blockchain as a valdiator master node, achieving high throughput by keeping the transactions per second (TPS) of the entire blockchain on an acceptable level. Ledgerium Blockchain's robust consensus mechanism enabled it to improve both Bitcoin and Ethereum 1.0 in terms of TPS.

High TPS guarantees low calculation delay, which allows transaction speeds to compete with existing payment systems such as VISA and SWIFT. This makes everyday purchases with XLG a convenient possibility.

### **Scalability**

Ledgerium Blockchain’s highly effective smart contracts offer high scalability, allowing applications to be deployed in a variety of ways. Configuration of powerful database structure and account system helps in simplifying complex data models bringing-in convenience to project development and simultaneously supporting high TPS.

### **High Availability**

The Ledgerium Blockchain nodes have the right built-in controls to ensure high availability and handle any planned switchover or an unplanned failure.

### **High Security**

Legerium Blockchain starts with 21 validator nodes that are continuously validating the data instilling a high-security transaction process that is transparent and immutable.
