# **What is Ledgerium Blockchain**
Blockledger is an organisation that brings Blockchain to the accounting and audit industry. We aim to create a decentralized ledger through a triple entry accounting system.

Ledgerium Blockchain is a distributed digital ledger that can record transactions between parties efficiently in a verifiable and permanent way. This allows the participants to verify and audit transactions instantly and inexpensively. The merits of Blockchain technology are exactly the current accounting and auditing industry needs. 

Ledgerium Blockchain is a fork and logical enhancements of J.P. Morgan's Quorum Protocol which in turn extension of The Etherum Foundation's Ethereum Protocol.   

### **Ethereum**  
Ethereum is an open-source, public, blockchain-based distributed computing platform and operating system featuring smart contract (scripting) functionality. It supports a modified version of Nakamoto consensus via transaction-based state transitions. [^1]

### **Quorum**  
Quorum is an Ethereum-based distributed ledger protocol that has been developed to provide the Financial Services Industry with a permissioned implementation of Ethereum that supports the transaction and contract privacy. [^2]

## **Key Features**
### **Distributed and Decentralized**
Distributed means not all the processing of the transactions are done in the same place. Decentralized means that not one single node has control over all the processing. By nature, Ledgerium Blockchain's transactions ledger is distributed among various parties. A lack of a single authority makes the system fairer and considerably more secure. 

### **Immutability**
Immutability means the ledger of transactions which once updated, can never be replaced or reversed or edited. Ledgerium Blockchain uses Istanbul Byzantine Fault Tolerance (IBFT) consensus mechanism which provides the one block finality. The blockchainâ€™s participants validate these transactions by reviewing their content with a sufficient level of validation. If any of the participants go back and try to update the content, other blockchain participants will immediately identify the discrepancy and invalidate the changes. 

### **Public as well as private transactions**
Ledgerium Blockchain extends JP Morgan's Quorum Blockchain protocol. It classifies the transactions into two types public and private. Public transactions will be accessible to any validator or non-validator master node. Private Transactions will be accessible for any predefined blockchain master nodes.

### **High Throughput**
Under Istanbul Byzantine Fault Tolerance (IBFT) consensus, a specified number of high performing nodes are selected by the blockchain as a valdiator master node, achieving high throughput by keeping the transactions per second (TPS) of the entire blockchain on an acceptable level. Ledgerium Blockchain's robust consensus mechanism enabled it to improve both Bitcoin and Ethereum 1.0 in terms of TPS.

High TPS guarantees low calculation delay, which allows transaction speeds to compete with existing payment systems such as VISA and SWIFT. This makes everyday purchases with TRX a convenient possibility.

### **Scalability**
Applications enjoy a wider variety of ways to be deployed in Ledgerium Blockchain because of the its scalability and highly effective smart contracts. Thanks to the high efficiency and infinite possibilities of the smart contract, Ledgerium Blockchain possesses great scalability, allowing for a wide variety of applications to be deployed in Ledgerium Blockchain.

The combination of an excellent database structure and account system simplifies the actualization of complex designs and models, which brings convenience to project development and supports high TPS. Existing applications, websites, and operating services can be transferred to the Ledgerium Blockchain, allowing them to better rival against existing institutions by benefiting from the large user base of the Ledgerium Blockchain.

### **High Availability**
High Availability is critical for any business application, whether for a planned switchover or an unplanned failure. The Ledgerium Blockchain's nodes are capable to handle either situation.  These nodes have the right built-in controls to ensure high availability. Additionally, the chain structure, user assets, are high available due to Ledgerium Blockchain's decentralized transaction ledger.

### **High security**
Higher number of Ledgerium Blockchain validators ensure the security of the transaction ledger as ledger will be immutable, transaparent, high available. Ledgerium Blockchain will start with 21 validator nodes.
